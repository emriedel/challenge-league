# Challenge League - Creative Competition Platform

## Project Overview
Challenge League is a web application inspired by Taskmaster, where players join leagues to compete in weekly challenges. Players submit photo responses to specific challenges, then vote on each other's submissions to determine winners and rankings.

**Purpose:** Foster creativity and friendly competition through weekly challenges
**Development Strategy:** Web-first with PWA features, mobile app to follow later
**Current Status:** MVP Complete - fully functional competition platform

## Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (same repo)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (Docker for development)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with email/password
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for photo uploads
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automated CI/CD
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (integration)
- **Future**: React Native app using same backend

All test accounts use password `password123`

## Database Development Workflow

Challenge League uses **PostgreSQL for both development and production** with Prisma's recommended migration workflow for safe, version-controlled database changes.

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker compose up -d

# Set up database with initial migration and test data
npm run db:init

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Making Database Schema Changes

Follow this **2-step workflow** for any database changes:

#### Step 1: Develop and Test Locally

```bash
# 1. Edit prisma/schema.prisma
# 2. Create migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name describe-your-change

# 3. Test your changes thoroughly
npm run dev

# 4. Update any affected TypeScript types/code
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Everything Automatically

```bash
# Commit ALL files including migration files
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: describe-your-change"

# Push to deploy code AND database changes automatically
git push
```

**That's it!** Migrations are applied automatically during the build process. No manual steps needed.

### Important Migration Rules

**✅ ALWAYS commit migration files** - Never let production auto-generate migrations  
**✅ Automated migrations** - CI/CD pipeline applies migrations safely during build  
**✅ Test locally first** - Create and test all changes in development  
**❌ Never manually run migrations in production** - Let the automated pipeline handle it  

### Common Database Commands

```bash
# Local development
docker compose up -d              # Start PostgreSQL
npm run db:init                   # Create initial migration and seed data (first time only)
npm run db:reset                  # Nuclear reset: drop database, reapply all migrations, seed fresh data
npm run db:seed                   # Refresh test data only (lighter option)
npx prisma studio                 # Browse database
npx prisma generate              # Generate Prisma client

# Production (rarely needed - migrations are automated!)
npx prisma migrate status        # Check migration status (debugging only)
# Note: Migrations are applied automatically during deployment
```

### Database Schema Structure

The application uses these key models:
- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **League**: Competition groups with configurable settings
- **LeagueMembership**: Many-to-many relationship between users and leagues
- **Prompt**: Creative challenges with 2-phase timing (ACTIVE → VOTING → COMPLETED)
- **Response**: User submissions with photos, captions, and voting results
- **Vote**: Individual votes cast by users (1 point each)
- **Comment**: User comments on responses
- **PushSubscription**: Web push notification subscriptions

### New League Startup Feature

Added `isStarted` boolean field to League model:
- New leagues start with `isStarted: false`
- League owners must manually start their leagues
- Only started leagues process prompt queues automatically
- Provides proper onboarding and control for league creators

## High Priority Refactoring Tasks

The following refactoring tasks have been identified as high priority for improving code quality, maintainability, and developer experience:

### 🔥 High Priority (Next Phase)
1. **Extract Database Query Patterns** - Create a data access layer to centralize common Prisma queries. Many components duplicate similar database operations (user lookups, league queries, etc.).

2. **Create Custom Data Fetching Hook (useApiQuery)** - Replace repetitive fetch patterns with a standardized hook that handles loading states, error handling, and caching consistently across all components.

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Future Phases)
3. **Improve Authentication State Management** - Create `useAuthRedirect` hook to handle authentication redirects and loading states consistently across protected routes.

4. **Extract Form Validation Patterns** - Create `useFormValidation` hook to centralize validation logic currently scattered across submission forms, user registration, and other forms.

5. **Optimize Image Loading** - Create `OptimizedImage` wrapper component to handle lazy loading, proper sizing, and fallback states for user submissions and profile photos.

6. **Add React.memo to Pure Components** - Identify and memoize components that don't need to re-render on every parent update (ProfileAvatar, ResultsGallery items, etc.).

7. **Implement Consistent Skeleton Loading States** - Standardize loading skeletons across all components to improve perceived performance.

8. **Create Centralized API Client Layer** - Build an API client with interceptors for authentication, error handling, and request/response transformation.

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on high priority items first as they impact code maintainability most significantly
- Each refactoring should maintain backward compatibility
- Run `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint` after each refactoring
- Update component interfaces to use centralized types from `/src/types/`
- Document breaking changes in git commit messages

## Theme System

### Semantic Color Classes
The app uses a custom Tailwind theme with semantic color names defined in `tailwind.config.js`. This allows for easy theme changes from a single location.

**Background Colors:**
- `bg-app-bg` - Main app background (pure black #000000)
- `bg-app-surface` - Cards, modals, elevated content (#1a1a1a)
- `bg-app-surface-dark` - Darker surfaces when needed (#0a0a0a)
- `bg-app-surface-light` - Lighter surfaces for hover states (#262626)

**Border Colors:**
- `border-app-border` - Primary border color (#404040)
- `border-app-border-light` - Lighter borders (#525252)
- `border-app-border-dark` - Darker borders (#262626)

**Text Colors:**
- `text-app-text` - Primary text (white #ffffff)
- `text-app-text-secondary` - Secondary text (light gray #a3a3a3)
- `text-app-text-muted` - Muted text (medium gray #737373)
- `text-app-text-subtle` - Very subtle text (#525252)

**Interactive & Status Colors:**
- `bg-app-hover` - White overlay for hover states
- `bg-app-active` - White overlay for active states
- `text-app-success`, `bg-app-success-bg` - Success colors
- `text-app-error`, `bg-app-error-bg` - Error colors
- `text-app-info` - Info color (blue)

**Brand Colors:**
- **Secondary Color**: `#3a8e8c` - App logo color, used for accent elements and calls-to-action
- **Primary Brand**: Black/white with secondary teal accents

### Changing Themes
To modify the app's color scheme:
1. Update the `app` color values in `tailwind.config.js`
2. All components will automatically use the new colors
3. No need to search/replace individual utility classes

### Current Theme: Dark Mode with Teal Accents
- Pure black backgrounds for modern dark aesthetic
- Subtle gray surfaces for content separation
- White/light gray text hierarchy for readability
- Teal secondary color (#3a8e8c) for branding and accent elements
- Blue preserved for interactive elements and info states

## Push Notifications System

### Overview
The app includes a comprehensive web push notification system that automatically notifies users of competition phase transitions.

### Features
- **Automatic Notifications**: Sent when prompts transition from ACTIVE to VOTING
- **Browser Support**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari 16.4+, and Edge
- **User Control**: Users can enable/disable via profile modal
- **Debug Panel**: Accessible via `?debug` URL parameter for troubleshooting

### Technical Implementation
- **VAPID Keys**: Secure server-to-browser communication
- **Service Worker**: `/public/sw.js` handles notification display
- **Database Storage**: Push subscriptions stored in `PushSubscription` model
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid subscriptions removed automatically

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Server-side VAPID keys (keep secret!)
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key  
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@challengeleague.com

# Client-side VAPID key (public, safe to expose)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Overview
Challenge League uses a comprehensive testing setup with both unit tests (Vitest) and integration tests (Playwright) to ensure all major functionality works correctly. The testing infrastructure provides **isolated database environments** and **comprehensive user flow automation** without interfering with development data.

### Integration Test Goal: Complete End-to-End Workflow

The primary goal is a **single comprehensive integration test** that validates this complete user journey:

1. **Account Management**
   - Create a new account (admin)
   - Add a profile photo
   - Create another new account (member)

2. **League Management** 
   - Create a league (admin)
   - Add prompts to league using League Settings page (admin only)
   - Join existing league (member)
   - Start the league (admin only)

3. **Challenge Workflow**
   - Submit photo and caption responses to first prompt (both accounts)
   - Transition league to voting stage using League Settings button (admin only)
   - Vote for photos (both accounts)
   - Transition to next prompt using League Settings button (admin only)

4. **Results Verification**
   - Verify next prompt shows on Challenge page
   - Verify Challenge Results page loads with last challenge results
   - Verify Standings page loads with current standings

### Current Implementation Status

#### ✅ **WORKING COMPONENTS** (Infrastructure Complete)

**Database & Authentication**
- **PostgreSQL Test Setup**: Fixed authentication and connection issues
- **Database Isolation**: Each test gets clean PostgreSQL database instance  
- **Schema Application**: Automated Prisma schema deployment for tests
- **User Registration**: Complete signup flow with profile setup working
- **Multi-user Support**: Can create and manage multiple test users concurrently
- **Profile Setup**: Fixed redirect path from signup → profile setup → main app

**League Management**  
- **League Creation**: Fixed URL paths (`/app/new`) and form validation (`#name`, `#description`)
- **League Join Flow**: Complete visual league browser with one-click join functionality
- **Available Leagues API**: Shows 27+ leagues with proper filtering (excludes already joined)
- **Member Navigation**: Fixed join flow navigation and league access
- **Admin Controls**: Proper admin-only feature detection and interaction

**Navigation & UI Elements**
- **Element Selector Debugging**: Systematic approach to identify and fix UI selectors

- **URL Pattern Recognition**: Corrected routing patterns (`/app/new` vs `/app/create`)
- **Multi-page Navigation**: All major pages accessible and responsive

**Test Framework & Debugging**
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automated debugging screenshots at failure points
- **Real-time Element Detection**: Can identify available buttons, links, and form fields
- **Error Analysis**: Systematic timeout analysis and selector validation
- **Browser Management**: Proper browser lifecycle and cleanup

#### 🚨 **CURRENT BLOCKER: League Settings Form Elements**

**Current Problem**: After successfully creating league, the test fails to locate prompt input fields in League Settings.

**Latest Progress**: 
- ✅ **Step 1**: Admin account creation and profile setup
- ✅ **Step 2**: League creation at `/app/new` with proper form fields
- ✅ **Step 3**: Navigation to League Settings page  
- ❌ **Step 4**: Cannot find prompt input field with selector `textarea[placeholder*="prompt"], textarea[name="prompt"], input[placeholder*="new prompt"]`

**Error Message**:
```
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator('textarea[placeholder*="prompt"], textarea[name="prompt"], input[placeholder*="new prompt"]')
```

**Next Debug Step**: Need to examine League Settings page structure to identify correct prompt input selectors.

### Test Architecture
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (isolated per test)
- **Test Isolation**: Unique database per test run
- **File Management**: Temporary test images with automatic cleanup

### Key Helper Functions (All Working)
```typescript
// Database Management
resetTestDb()              // Creates isolated test database
cleanupTestDb()           // Removes test database and files

// User Workflows
registerUser()            // Complete account creation flow
createLeague()            // Creates league and returns ID
joinLeagueById()          // Member joins existing league

// Admin Functions
clearLeaguePrompts()      // Database-level prompt queue cleanup
addPromptToLeague()       // UI-based prompt addition via settings
transitionLeaguePhase()   // Manual phase transitions via UI

// Challenge Workflows

```

### Running Tests

#### Comprehensive Integration Test
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test (currently fails at League Settings)
npm run test:integration:comprehensive

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:integration:ui

# View captured screenshots
ls -la test-screenshots/
```

**Current Result**: Successfully completes league creation, fails at prompt input field detection.

#### Basic Integration Test
```bash  
# Test basic user flows (fully working)
npm run test:integration:basic

# View test results and screenshots
npx playwright show-report
```

**Current Result**: ✅ Completely successful - validates core user workflows.

### Next Steps to Complete Integration Tests

#### 🔥 **IMMEDIATE (Required for completion)**
1. **Debug League Settings Page** - Create debug script to screenshot and identify prompt input selectors
2. **Fix Prompt Input Selectors** - Update test with correct form field selectors
3. **Complete League Settings Workflow** - Test prompt addition and league startup

#### 🎯 **NEXT (Complete workflow)**  
4. **Validate Photo Submission** - Test submission with proper prompt activation
5. **Complete Phase Transitions** - Test ACTIVE → VOTING → COMPLETED cycle
6. **Implement Vote Casting** - Test voting phase functionality
7. **Verify Results Processing** - Test results and standings pages

#### 🔧 **FINAL (Polish)**
8. **Add Error Scenarios** - Test edge cases and error handling
9. **Performance Validation** - Ensure test runs consistently under 2 minutes
10. **Documentation Update** - Document complete working test suite

The comprehensive workflow test successfully completes Steps 1-3 (account creation, league creation, league settings navigation), then fails at Step 4 (prompt input field interaction) due to selector issues. Once this selector issue is resolved, the remaining components should work immediately since all the helper functions and UI interactions are already implemented and tested.
