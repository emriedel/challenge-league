# Challenge League - Creative Competition Platform

## Project Overview
Challenge League is a web application inspired by Taskmaster, where players join leagues to compete in weekly challenges. Players submit photo responses to specific challenges, then vote on each other's submissions to determine winners and rankings.

**Purpose:** Foster creativity and friendly competition through weekly challenges
**Development Strategy:** Web-first with PWA features, mobile app to follow later
**Current Status:** MVP Complete

## Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (same repo)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (Docker for development)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with email/password
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for photo uploads
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automated CI/CD
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (integration)
- **Future**: React Native app using same backend

## Development Guidelines

- Multiple challenge categories represented
- Complete competition cycle examples

All test accounts use password `password123`

## Database Development Workflow

Challenge League uses **PostgreSQL for both development and production** with Prisma's recommended migration workflow for safe, version-controlled database changes.

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker compose up -d

# Set up database with initial migration and test data
npm run db:init

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Making Database Schema Changes

Follow this **2-step workflow** for any database changes:

#### Step 1: Develop and Test Locally

```bash
# 1. Edit prisma/schema.prisma
# 2. Create migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name describe-your-change

# 3. Test your changes thoroughly
npm run dev

# 4. Update any affected TypeScript types/code
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Everything Automatically

```bash
# Commit ALL files including migration files
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: describe-your-change"

# Push to deploy code AND database changes automatically
git push
```

**That's it!** Migrations are applied automatically during the build process. No manual steps needed.

### Important Migration Rules

**✅ ALWAYS commit migration files** - Never let production auto-generate migrations  
**✅ Automated migrations** - CI/CD pipeline applies migrations safely during build  
**✅ Test locally first** - Create and test all changes in development  
**❌ Never manually run migrations in production** - Let the automated pipeline handle it  

### Common Database Commands

```bash
# Local development
docker compose up -d              # Start PostgreSQL
npm run db:init                   # Create initial migration and seed data (first time only)
npm run db:reset                  # Nuclear reset: drop database, reapply all migrations, seed fresh data
npm run db:seed                   # Refresh test data only (lighter option)
npx prisma studio                 # Browse database
npx prisma generate              # Generate Prisma client

# Production (rarely needed - migrations are automated!)
npx prisma migrate status        # Check migration status (debugging only)
# Note: Migrations are applied automatically during deployment
```

### Database Schema Structure

The application uses these key models:
- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **League**: Competition groups with configurable settings
- **LeagueMembership**: Many-to-many relationship between users and leagues
- **Prompt**: Creative challenges with 2-phase timing (ACTIVE → VOTING → COMPLETED)
- **Response**: User submissions with photos, captions, and voting results
- **Vote**: Individual votes cast by users (1 point each)
- **Comment**: User comments on responses
- **PushSubscription**: Web push notification subscriptions

### New League Startup Feature

Added `isStarted` boolean field to League model:
- New leagues start with `isStarted: false`
- League owners must manually start their leagues
- Only started leagues process prompt queues automatically
- Provides proper onboarding and control for league creators

## High Priority Refactoring Tasks

The following refactoring tasks have been identified as high priority for improving code quality, maintainability, and developer experience:

### 🔥 High Priority (Next Phase)
1. **Extract Database Query Patterns** - Create a data access layer to centralize common Prisma queries. Many components duplicate similar database operations (user lookups, league queries, etc.).

2. **Create Custom Data Fetching Hook (useApiQuery)** - Replace repetitive fetch patterns with a standardized hook that handles loading states, error handling, and caching consistently across all components.

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Future Phases)
3. **Improve Authentication State Management** - Create `useAuthRedirect` hook to handle authentication redirects and loading states consistently across protected routes.

4. **Extract Form Validation Patterns** - Create `useFormValidation` hook to centralize validation logic currently scattered across submission forms, user registration, and other forms.

5. **Optimize Image Loading** - Create `OptimizedImage` wrapper component to handle lazy loading, proper sizing, and fallback states for user submissions and profile photos.

6. **Add React.memo to Pure Components** - Identify and memoize components that don't need to re-render on every parent update (ProfileAvatar, ResultsGallery items, etc.).

7. **Implement Consistent Skeleton Loading States** - Standardize loading skeletons across all components to improve perceived performance.

8. **Create Centralized API Client Layer** - Build an API client with interceptors for authentication, error handling, and request/response transformation.

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on high priority items first as they impact code maintainability most significantly
- Each refactoring should maintain backward compatibility
- Run `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint` after each refactoring
- Update component interfaces to use centralized types from `/src/types/`
- Document breaking changes in git commit messages

## Theme System

### Semantic Color Classes
The app uses a custom Tailwind theme with semantic color names defined in `tailwind.config.js`. This allows for easy theme changes from a single location.

**Background Colors:**
- `bg-app-bg` - Main app background (pure black #000000)
- `bg-app-surface` - Cards, modals, elevated content (#1a1a1a)
- `bg-app-surface-dark` - Darker surfaces when needed (#0a0a0a)
- `bg-app-surface-light` - Lighter surfaces for hover states (#262626)

**Border Colors:**
- `border-app-border` - Primary border color (#404040)
- `border-app-border-light` - Lighter borders (#525252)
- `border-app-border-dark` - Darker borders (#262626)

**Text Colors:**
- `text-app-text` - Primary text (white #ffffff)
- `text-app-text-secondary` - Secondary text (light gray #a3a3a3)
- `text-app-text-muted` - Muted text (medium gray #737373)
- `text-app-text-subtle` - Very subtle text (#525252)

**Interactive & Status Colors:**
- `bg-app-hover` - White overlay for hover states
- `bg-app-active` - White overlay for active states
- `text-app-success`, `bg-app-success-bg` - Success colors
- `text-app-error`, `bg-app-error-bg` - Error colors
- `text-app-info` - Info color (blue)

**Destructive Actions:**
- **Muted Red**: `#8b4444` (background), `#7a3d3d` (hover) - Used for sign out buttons and other destructive actions that need to fit the app's muted aesthetic

**Brand Colors:**
- **Secondary Color**: `#3a8e8c` - App logo color, used for accent elements and calls-to-action
- **Primary Brand**: Black/white with secondary teal accents

### Changing Themes
To modify the app's color scheme:
1. Update the `app` color values in `tailwind.config.js`
2. All components will automatically use the new colors
3. No need to search/replace individual utility classes

### Current Theme: Dark Mode with Teal Accents
- Pure black backgrounds for modern dark aesthetic
- Subtle gray surfaces for content separation
- White/light gray text hierarchy for readability
- Teal secondary color (#3a8e8c) for branding and accent elements
- Blue preserved for interactive elements and info states

## Push Notifications System

### Overview
The app includes a comprehensive web push notification system that automatically notifies users of competition phase transitions.

### Features
- **Automatic Notifications**: Sent when prompts transition from ACTIVE to VOTING
- **Browser Support**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari 16.4+, and Edge
- **User Control**: Users can enable/disable via profile modal
- **Debug Panel**: Accessible via `?debug` URL parameter for troubleshooting

### Technical Implementation
- **VAPID Keys**: Secure server-to-browser communication
- **Service Worker**: `/public/sw.js` handles notification display
- **Database Storage**: Push subscriptions stored in `PushSubscription` model
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid subscriptions removed automatically

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Server-side VAPID keys (keep secret!)
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key  
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@challengeleague.com

# Client-side VAPID key (public, safe to expose)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Overview
Challenge League uses a comprehensive testing setup with both unit tests (Vitest) and integration tests (Playwright) to ensure all major functionality works correctly. The testing infrastructure provides **completely isolated database environments** and **comprehensive user flow automation** without interfering with development data.

### ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: INTEGRATION TESTS WORKING**

**Database isolation has been completely solved!** The integration test infrastructure now provides true isolation while maintaining full functionality.

#### 🎯 **What's Working (95% Complete)**

**Database & Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Complete Database Isolation**: Test and Next.js app share dedicated test database on port 5433
- ✅ **Docker Test Environment**: Automated test container management with `docker-compose.test.yml`
- ✅ **Schema Management**: Automated Prisma schema application to test database
- ✅ **Clean Test Runs**: Each test gets fresh database state with proper cleanup

**User & League Management**
- ✅ **User Registration**: Complete signup flow with profile setup
- ✅ **Multi-user Support**: Creates and manages multiple test users concurrently
- ✅ **League Creation**: Admin creates leagues with proper settings
- ✅ **League Joining**: Member joins leagues via UI
- ✅ **Prompt Addition**: Admin adds challenges to queue via League Settings

**Advanced Features**
- ✅ **Phase Transitions**: ACTIVE → VOTING → COMPLETED cycle working
- ✅ **Database Communication**: Test can read league state, prompts, and transitions
- ✅ **Queue Management**: Prompt ordering and activation logic functional
- ✅ **UI Navigation**: All major pages accessible and functional

#### 🔧 **Minor Issues Remaining (5%)**

1. **League Startup**: League shows `Started: false` - needs "Start League" button click
2. **Prompt Queue Order**: Wrong prompt activated (pre-existing vs newly added)
