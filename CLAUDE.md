# Challenge League - Creative Competition Platform

## Project Overview
Challenge League is a creative competition web application inspired by Taskmaster, where players join leagues to compete in weekly creative challenges. Players submit photo responses to specific tasks, then vote on each other's submissions to determine winners and rankings.

**Purpose:** Foster creativity and friendly competition through engaging weekly challenges
**Development Strategy:** Web-first with PWA features, mobile app to follow later
**Core Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes (same repo)
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (or SQLite for development)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- File Storage: Vercel Blob or AWS S3
- Deployment: Vercel
- Future: React Native app using same backend

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration with Prettier formatting
- Component-based architecture with hooks
- Functional components preferred over class components
- Use custom hooks for business logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                 # Next.js app directory (pages and layouts)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                # Database, auth, and utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/          # App constants and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Static assets
â””â”€â”€ styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### State Management
- Use React Context + useReducer for global state
- Server-side state management with Next.js
- Local component state for UI-specific data

## High Priority Refactoring Tasks

The following refactoring tasks have been identified as high priority for improving code quality, maintainability, and developer experience:

### âœ… Completed Refactorings
- **Type Consolidation** - Centralized all TypeScript type definitions into `/src/types/` directory with proper organization and barrel exports. Eliminated duplicate types across 15+ files.
- **Standardize API Route Error Handling** - Created consistent error response format across all API endpoints with centralized `ApiError` classes, proper status codes, and structured error responses. Enhanced `createApiHandler` to use standardized error handling.

### ðŸ”¥ High Priority (Next Phase)
1. **Extract Database Query Patterns** - Create a data access layer to centralize common Prisma queries. Many components duplicate similar database operations (user lookups, league queries, etc.).

2. **Create Custom Data Fetching Hook (useApiQuery)** - Replace repetitive fetch patterns with a standardized hook that handles loading states, error handling, and caching consistently across all components.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Future Phases)
3. **Improve Authentication State Management** - Create `useAuthRedirect` hook to handle authentication redirects and loading states consistently across protected routes.

4. **Extract Form Validation Patterns** - Create `useFormValidation` hook to centralize validation logic currently scattered across submission forms, user registration, and other forms.

5. **Optimize Image Loading** - Create `OptimizedImage` wrapper component to handle lazy loading, proper sizing, and fallback states for user submissions and profile photos.

6. **Add React.memo to Pure Components** - Identify and memoize components that don't need to re-render on every parent update (ProfileAvatar, ResultsGallery items, etc.).

7. **Implement Consistent Skeleton Loading States** - Standardize loading skeletons across all components to improve perceived performance.

8. **Create Centralized API Client Layer** - Build an API client with interceptors for authentication, error handling, and request/response transformation.

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on high priority items first as they impact code maintainability most significantly
- Each refactoring should maintain backward compatibility
- Run `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint` after each refactoring
- Update component interfaces to use centralized types from `/src/types/`
- Document breaking changes in git commit messages
