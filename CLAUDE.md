# Glimpse - Creative Competition League

## Project Overview
Glimpse is a creative competition web application inspired by Taskmaster, where players join leagues to compete in weekly creative challenges. Players submit photo responses to specific tasks, then vote on each other's submissions to determine winners and rankings.

**Purpose:** Foster creativity and friendly competition through engaging weekly challenges
**Development Strategy:** Web-first with PWA features, mobile app to follow later
**Core Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes (same repo)
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (or SQLite for development)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- File Storage: Vercel Blob or AWS S3
- Deployment: Vercel
- Future: React Native app using same backend

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration with Prettier formatting
- Component-based architecture with hooks
- Functional components preferred over class components
- Use custom hooks for business logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### File Structure
```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js app directory (pages and layouts)
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                # Database, auth, and utility functions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
├── constants/          # App constants and configuration
├── public/             # Static assets
└── styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind config
```

### State Management
- Use React Context + useReducer for global state
- Server-side state management with Next.js
- Local component state for UI-specific data

### Testing Approach
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage on business logic
