# Glimpse üì∏

> A web application that encourages meaningful sharing through weekly photo prompts

Glimpse transforms how we share memories by giving you exactly one week to respond to a thoughtful prompt. Every Saturday at noon PT, all responses are published simultaneously and the next prompt becomes available. No endless scrolling, no daily pressure‚Äîjust intentional sharing with friends.

## ‚ú® How It Works

**The Weekly Cycle:**
1. **Saturday 12 PM PT**: New prompt releases, previous responses published
2. **Submission Window**: You have exactly 7 days to submit your photo and caption  
3. **Waiting Period**: After submitting, see "waiting for others" until window closes
4. **Gallery Moment**: Everyone's responses appear at once when the cycle resets

**Two Simple Pages:**
- **Gallery**: Scroll through your friends' responses from last week
- **Submit**: See the current prompt, upload your photo, write your caption

## üéØ The Philosophy

Glimpse addresses social media fatigue by:
- **Synchronized sharing**: Everyone responds to the same prompt, published together
- **Time boundaries**: Exactly one week to submit, no editing after
- **Friends only**: Intimate sharing without public pressure  
- **Ephemeral content**: Photos are deleted after each cycle
- **Quality over quantity**: One meaningful post per week

### Example Prompts
- "Share your favorite vacation photo and tell us why it was special"
- "Post the oldest photo of yourself on your phone"
- "What's the best activity you did this week?"
- "Share a photo of something that made you smile recently"
- "Post a picture of your favorite comfort food"

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Git
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/glimpse.git
   cd glimpse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## üîê Test Accounts

The database seed creates test users for development:

- **Email**: `user1@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `user2@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`  
- **Email**: `user3@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `user4@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `user5@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`

**Admin Access**: `testuser1` has admin privileges for managing prompts at `/admin`

All test accounts are already connected as friends, so you can see content across accounts.

## üåê Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (same repo)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (SQLite for development)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Future**: React Native mobile app using same backend
