### Admin Access
- **Basic Seed**: `player1` has admin access to `/league-settings`

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Reset database and apply schema
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed with competition data
npx prisma db seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Testing Photo Uploads
- **Development Mode**: Photos stored locally in `public/uploads/`
- **Production Mode**: Requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` for Vercel Blob
- App automatically falls back to local storage when blob token is missing
- Supports drag-and-drop upload with preview

### 3. Testing the Complete Competition Flow

#### Phase 1: Submission (7 days)
1. Sign in with `player1@example.com` / `password123`
2. Go to **League Dashboard** (`/`) to see current challenge status
3. Go to `/submit` to upload photo and caption for active challenge
4. Submit response (stored as unpublished until submission window closes)
5. Test with multiple players to simulate competition

#### Phase 2: Voting (2 days)
1. Wait for submission window to close (or manually trigger cycle in admin)
2. Voting tab becomes active on the dashboard
3. Players distribute 3 equal-value votes among submissions
4. Cannot vote for own submission
5. Test voting with different player accounts

#### Phase 3: Results & New Challenge
1. Results are calculated automatically when voting closes
2. Winners announced with full rankings
3. Leaderboard updates with new points and statistics
4. Next challenge begins automatically

### 4. Admin Testing
1. Sign in as `player1@example.com`
2. Go to `/admin` to access challenge management
3. **Create Challenges**: Add new tasks with categories and difficulty
4. **Manage Queue**: Reorder upcoming challenges
5. **Manual Processing**: Trigger cycle transitions for testing
6. **Monitor Status**: View current prompt states and queue

### 5. Database Management
```bash
# Reset database completely
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Basic seed (6 players, basic data)
npx prisma db seed

# Large seed (20 players, 5 completed rounds, realistic data)
npx tsx prisma/seed-large.ts

# View database in browser
npx prisma studio

# Generate client after schema changes
npx prisma generate
```

#### Choosing Your Seed Data
- **Basic Seed**: Ideal for development and testing core features
- **Large Seed**: Perfect for testing UI with realistic data volumes, leaderboards, and full competition history
- **Custom Data**: Modify seed scripts in `prisma/` directory for specific test scenarios

#### Important Note About Sessions
Both seed scripts automatically clear all user sessions when they run. This means:
- **After running any seed script, all users will be logged out**
- **You'll need to log in again** with the new account credentials
- **This prevents stale session issues** where old user IDs don't match the new database data
- **This is expected behavior** - the seed scripts tell you when sessions are cleared

### 6. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```bash
# Database (SQLite for development)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="dev-secret-key-replace-in-production"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# File Storage (optional for development)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your-vercel-blob-token-here"

# Cron Security (for production)
CRON_SECRET="your-cron-secret-here"
```

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Errors
If you see NextAuth.js errors:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Database Issues
If database seems corrupted:
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
npx prisma db seed
```

### Upload Errors
- Ensure `public/uploads/` directory exists and is writable
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Verify user is authenticated before uploading
- Check image format is supported (jpg, png, gif, webp)

2. Add sample tasks in `prisma/seed.ts`
3. Test different prompt styles and formats

### Customizing Scoring System
- Modify point values in voting API endpoints
- Update vote calculation logic in `promptQueue.ts`
- Adjust ranking algorithms as needed

### Performance Testing
- Test with larger numbers of submissions

## üöÄ Next Steps

After local testing:
1. Deploy to Vercel with environment variables
2. Set up Vercel Blob for production photo storage
3. Configure cron jobs for automatic cycle management
4. Monitor competition engagement and adjust timing
5. Plan Phase 2 features (multiple leagues, achievements)
