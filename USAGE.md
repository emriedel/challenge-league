## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Competition Rules

**Modifying Vote Values:**
Edit point values in `/src/app/api/votes/route.ts`:
```typescript
const points = 4 - rank; // 1st=3pts, 2nd=2pts, 3rd=1pt
```

**Changing Cycle Timing:**
Adjust schedules in `/src/lib/promptQueue.ts`:
```typescript
const voteEnd = new Date(voteStart);
voteEnd.setDate(voteEnd.getDate() + 2); // 2 days voting
```

**Adding New Categories:**
Update categories in `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const categories = ['Cooking', 'Creativity', 'Photography', 'YourNewCategory'];
```

### Performance Optimization

**Image Optimization:**
- Automatic image compression via Vercel Blob
- Responsive image loading
- Lazy loading for gallery views
- Next.js Image component optimization

**Database Performance:**
```bash
# Analyze query performance
npx prisma studio

# Check index usage
# Monitor slow queries in production
```

```

**Vote Submission Errors:**
- Ensure exactly 3 votes are selected

- Verify voting window is still open
- Try refreshing the page and re-voting

**Upload Issues:**
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Verify image format is supported (jpg, png, gif, webp)
- Ensure `public/uploads/` directory exists for development
- Check `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` for production

**Admin Access Issues:**
- Confirm you're signed in as `player1@example.com`
- Check that username is exactly `player1`
- Clear browser cache and re-login
- Verify admin API routes are working

### Performance Issues

**Slow Loading:**
```bash
# Build and test production version
npm run build
npm start

# Check bundle size
npx @next/bundle-analyzer
```

**Memory Issues:**
- Monitor database size growth
- Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions
- Verify photo cleanup is working correctly

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

**Environment Variables to Set:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-production-postgresql-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your-production-blob-token"
CRON_SECRET="your-cron-secret"
```

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main
4. Verify cron jobs are working (check logs)
5. Test competition flow in production

### Production Considerations

**Database:**
- Use PostgreSQL for production (not SQLite)
- Set up regular backups
- Monitor query performance
- Plan for user growth

**File Storage:**
- Vercel Blob handles scaling automatically
- Monitor storage usage and costs
- Set up CDN for global performance

**Monitoring:**
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Monitor cron job execution
- Track user engagement metrics
- Watch for abuse or gaming attempts
