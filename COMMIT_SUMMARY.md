## 🚧 What's Disabled (Email Sending)

All three email triggers are commented out:

1. **Forgot Password Link** - Hidden from sign-in page
2. **Password Reset Email** - API doesn't send email (logs only)
3. **Challenge Notifications** - Cron job doesn't send emails (logs only)

**To Re-Enable:** Uncomment code at three locations marked with:
```typescript
// TODO: Re-enable when email system is launched
```

---

## ✅ What Still Works

Everything else functions normally:
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ League management
- ✅ Challenge submissions and voting
- ✅ Push notifications
- ✅ Cron job phase transitions
- ✅ Database updates (tokens still generated)
- ✅ UI flows (pages exist, just no emails sent)

---

## 📊 Test Results

**TypeScript Compilation:**
```
✓ No type errors
```

**ESLint:**
```
✓ No warnings or errors
```

**Production Build:**
```
✓ Build successful
✓ All routes compiled
✓ No build warnings
```

**API Key Audit:**
```
✓ No hardcoded keys found
✓ Only env variable references
✓ .env.local properly gitignored
```

## 🚀 Safe to Deploy

This commit is **100% safe** to deploy to production because:

1. ✅ No emails will be sent (all sending disabled)
2. ✅ No API keys exposed in code
3. ✅ No breaking changes to existing features
4. ✅ Build successful with no errors
5. ✅ Database migration is additive only (no data loss)
6. ✅ All new pages/routes are functional but dormant

## 📋 Next Steps After Commit

### Phase 1: Test & Review
1. Create test email script
2. Send test emails to Eric for review
3. Iterate on templates based on feedback
