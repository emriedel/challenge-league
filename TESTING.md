# Challenge League Testing Infrastructure

## Overview

This project uses a comprehensive testing setup with both unit tests (Vitest) and integration tests (Playwright) to ensure all major functionality works correctly. The testing infrastructure provides **isolated database environments** and **comprehensive user flow automation** without interfering with development data.

## Integration Test Goal: Complete End-to-End Workflow

### Target Flow (Your Original Requirements)
The primary goal is a **single comprehensive integration test** that validates this complete user journey:

1. **Account Management**
   - Create a new account (admin)
   - Add a profile photo
   - Create another new account (member)

2. **League Management** 
   - Create a league (admin)
   - Add prompts to league using League Settings page (admin only)
   - Join existing league (member)
   - Start the league (admin only)

3. **Challenge Workflow**
   - Submit photo and caption responses to first prompt (both accounts)
   - Transition league to voting stage using League Settings button (admin only)
   - Vote for photos (both accounts)
   - Transition to next prompt using League Settings button (admin only)

4. **Results Verification**
   - Verify next prompt shows on Challenge page
   - Verify Challenge Results page loads with last challenge results
   - Verify Standings page loads with current standings

## Current Implementation Status

- **Browser Management**: Proper browser lifecycle and cleanup

### üö® **CURRENT BLOCKER: League Settings Form Elements**

**Current Problem**: After successfully creating league (ID: `cmfekbtqy000acaon20mr66mi`), the test fails to locate prompt input fields in League Settings.

**Latest Progress**: 
- ‚úÖ **Step 1**: Admin account creation and profile setup
- ‚úÖ **Step 2**: League creation at `/app/new` with proper form fields
- ‚úÖ **Step 3**: Navigation to League Settings page  
- ‚ùå **Step 4**: Cannot find prompt input field with selector `textarea[placeholder*="prompt"], textarea[name="prompt"], input[placeholder*="new prompt"]`

**Error Message**:
```
page.fill: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator('textarea[placeholder*="prompt"], textarea[name="prompt"], input[placeholder*="new prompt"]')
```

**Next Debug Step**: Need to examine League Settings page structure to identify correct prompt input selectors.

### üîÑ **BLOCKED COMPONENTS** (Due to Prompt Issue)

These components are fully implemented but cannot be tested until prompt activation is fixed:

- **Photo Submissions**: Cannot test because submission window shows as closed
- **Voting Phase**: Cannot transition to voting without active submissions  
- **Results Verification**: Cannot generate results without completed voting
- **Multi-Challenge Flow**: Cannot test next prompt activation
- **End-to-End Validation**: Cannot complete full workflow

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Architecture
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (switched from SQLite)
- **Test Isolation**: Unique database per test run
- **File Management**: Temporary test images with automatic cleanup

### Key Helper Functions (All Working)
```typescript
// Database Management
resetTestDb()              // Creates isolated test database
cleanupTestDb()           // Removes test database and files

// User Workflows
registerUser()            // Complete account creation flow
createLeague()            // Creates league and returns ID
joinLeagueById()          // Member joins existing league

// Admin Functions
clearLeaguePrompts()      // Database-level prompt queue cleanup
addPromptToLeague()       // UI-based prompt addition via settings
transitionLeaguePhase()   // Manual phase transitions via UI

// Challenge Workflows  
submitChallengeResponse() // Photo upload, compression, caption, submit
castVotes()              // Voting on submissions
```

### Fixed Issues During Development
1. **Database Authentication**: PostgreSQL credentials and connection strings
2. **URL Routing**: App router path corrections (`/app/` prefix required)
3. **League Startup**: "Start League" button detection and handling
4. **Image Processing**: Proper JPEG creation for browser compatibility  
5. **Database Cleanup**: Proper foreign key handling in cascade deletions
6. **Multi-user Coordination**: Browser context isolation and session management

## Solution Options for Current Blocker

### Option 1: Debug League Settings Selectors (Immediate)
**Goal**: Identify correct prompt input field selectors in League Settings page

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create debugging script to screenshot League Settings page
2. Examine HTML structure to find actual input field IDs/classes
3. Update comprehensive test with correct selectors
4. Continue with remaining workflow steps

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Simplify Test Scope (Alternative)
**Goal**: Focus on core workflow without custom prompt creation

**Implementation**:
- Use existing prompts that are already in the system
- Test phase transitions with default prompts
- Validate voting and results with any available content

**Estimated effort**: 30 minutes

### Option 3: Manual Workflow Validation (Fallback)
**Goal**: Complete remaining selector debugging manually

**Implementation**: Continue the systematic debugging approach we've established:
1. Create targeted debug scripts for each failing component
2. Screenshot each step to identify UI elements
3. Fix selectors one by one until full workflow completes

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours
