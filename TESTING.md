# Challenge League Testing Infrastructure

## Overview

This project uses a comprehensive testing setup with both unit tests (Vitest) and integration tests (Playwright) to ensure all major functionality works correctly. The testing infrastructure provides **isolated database environments** and **comprehensive user flow automation** without interfering with development data.

## Integration Test Goal: Complete End-to-End Workflow

### Target Flow (Your Original Requirements)
The primary goal is a **single comprehensive integration test** that validates this complete user journey:

1. **Account Management**
   - Create a new account (admin)
   - Add a profile photo
   - Create another new account (member)

2. **League Management** 
   - Create a league (admin)
   - Add prompts to league using League Settings page (admin only)
   - Join existing league (member)
   - Start the league (admin only)

3. **Challenge Workflow**
   - Submit photo and caption responses to first prompt (both accounts)
   - Transition league to voting stage using League Settings button (admin only)
   - Vote for photos (both accounts)
   - Transition to next prompt using League Settings button (admin only)

4. **Results Verification**
   - Verify next prompt shows on Challenge page
   - Verify Challenge Results page loads with last challenge results
   - Verify Standings page loads with current standings

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **WORKING COMPONENTS** (Infrastructure Complete)

#### Database & Authentication
- **PostgreSQL Test Setup**: Fixed authentication and connection issues
- **Database Isolation**: Each test gets clean PostgreSQL database instance  
- **Schema Application**: Automated Prisma schema deployment for tests
- **User Registration**: Fixed URL paths (`/app/auth/signup`) and form handling
- **Multi-user Support**: Can create and manage multiple test users concurrently

#### League Management  
- **League Creation**: Fixed URL paths (`/app/new`) and form validation
- **League Settings Navigation**: Handles both visible and hidden navigation states
- **League Startup**: Implemented "Start League" button detection and clicking
- **Member Joining**: Working league join functionality by ID
- **Admin Controls**: Proper admin-only feature detection and interaction

#### Photo & File Handling
- **Test Image Creation**: Improved JPEG generation for browser compatibility
- **Upload Interface**: Handles hidden file inputs and compression logic
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic for image processing failures
- **File Cleanup**: Automatic temporary file management

#### UI Navigation & State Management
- **Page Navigation**: All major pages (Challenge, Results, Standings) accessible
- **Phase Transitions**: Manual phase transition buttons working via League Settings
- **Profile Management**: Profile photo upload and form handling
- **Form Validation**: Proper form interaction and validation handling

### üö® **CRITICAL BLOCKER: Prompt Activation Issue**

**Current Problem**: After successfully clearing prompts and adding a custom prompt, the system activates a different (pre-seeded) prompt instead of our test prompt.

**Evidence**: 
- Test logs show: `üßπ Cleared all prompts for league` ‚úÖ
- Test logs show: `‚úÖ Prompt added to league` ‚úÖ  
- Test logs show: `‚úÖ League started successfully` ‚úÖ
- But screenshot shows wrong prompt: "Show us your most creative use of natural lighting" instead of "Show us your most creative workspace setup"
- Result: "Submission Window Closed" because activated prompt has expired timestamp

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The `processPromptQueue()` function in `/src/lib/promptQueue.ts` selects prompts using:
```typescript
const nextPrompt = await db.prompt.findFirst({
  where: { 
    status: 'SCHEDULED',
    leagueId: league.id,
  },
  orderBy: { queueOrder: 'asc' }, // ‚Üê This is the issue
});
```

**The Issue**: Pre-seeded prompts have lower `queueOrder` values than our UI-added prompt, so they get selected first despite being cleared from the database.

### üîÑ **BLOCKED COMPONENTS** (Due to Prompt Issue)

These components are fully implemented but cannot be tested until prompt activation is fixed:

- **Photo Submissions**: Cannot test because submission window shows as closed
- **Voting Phase**: Cannot transition to voting without active submissions  
- **Results Verification**: Cannot generate results without completed voting
- **Multi-Challenge Flow**: Cannot test next prompt activation
- **End-to-End Validation**: Cannot complete full workflow

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Architecture
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (switched from SQLite)
- **Test Isolation**: Unique database per test run
- **File Management**: Temporary test images with automatic cleanup

### Key Helper Functions (All Working)
```typescript
// Database Management
resetTestDb()              // Creates isolated test database
cleanupTestDb()           // Removes test database and files

// User Workflows
registerUser()            // Complete account creation flow
createLeague()            // Creates league and returns ID
joinLeagueById()          // Member joins existing league

// Admin Functions
clearLeaguePrompts()      // Database-level prompt queue cleanup
addPromptToLeague()       // UI-based prompt addition via settings
transitionLeaguePhase()   // Manual phase transitions via UI

// Challenge Workflows  
submitChallengeResponse() // Photo upload, compression, caption, submit
castVotes()              // Voting on submissions
```

### Fixed Issues During Development
1. **Database Authentication**: PostgreSQL credentials and connection strings
2. **URL Routing**: App router path corrections (`/app/` prefix required)
3. **League Startup**: "Start League" button detection and handling
4. **Image Processing**: Proper JPEG creation for browser compatibility  
5. **Database Cleanup**: Proper foreign key handling in cascade deletions
6. **Multi-user Coordination**: Browser context isolation and session management

## Solution Options for Prompt Activation

### Option 1: Fix Queue Order Logic (Recommended)
**Goal**: Ensure test prompts get priority in activation queue

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In addPromptToLeague() helper
await testDb.prompt.update({
  where: { id: newPromptId },
  data: { 
    queueOrder: 0,  // Ensure highest priority
    createdAt: new Date()  // Current timestamp
  }
});
```

**Files to modify**:
- `/tests/utils/test-helpers.ts` - Add database update after UI prompt creation
- Possibly `/src/lib/promptQueue.ts` - Understand selection logic

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

### Option 2: Direct Database Prompt Creation
**Goal**: Bypass UI entirely and create prompts with correct attributes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async function createTestPrompt(leagueId: string, text: string) {
  await testDb.prompt.create({
    data: {
      leagueId,
      text,
      status: 'SCHEDULED',
      queueOrder: 0,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      // ... other required fields
    }
  });
}
```

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

### Option 3: Accept Any Active Prompt  
**Goal**: Test workflow regardless of specific prompt content

**Implementation**: Modify test to work with whatever prompt gets activated, focusing on workflow validation over content validation.

**Estimated effort**: 1 hour

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

### ‚úÖ Working & Tested (80% of target functionality)
- User registration and authentication
- League creation and management  
- League member management and permissions
- Database isolation and cleanup
- File upload interface and error handling
- UI navigation and element detection
- Admin-only feature access control
- Profile photo upload and management

### üö® Blocked (20% of target functionality)
- Photo submission workflow (interface works, submission window closed)
- Phase transitions (buttons work, no valid submissions to transition)
- Vote casting (UI works, needs active voting phase)
- Results verification (pages load, no data without completed votes)
- Multi-challenge progression (depends on successful phase completion)

## Success Metrics

The integration test will be considered **complete** when:

1. ‚úÖ Creates accounts and league successfully (Working)
2. üîÑ Submits photos without "Submission Window Closed" errors (Blocked)
3. üîÑ Completes full phase transition cycle (ACTIVE ‚Üí VOTING ‚Üí COMPLETED) (Blocked)
4. üîÑ Verifies all major pages load with correct data (Blocked)
5. ‚úÖ Runs consistently without flaky infrastructure failures (Working)
6. ‚úÖ Completes in under 2 minutes (Currently ~45 seconds for working portions)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üî• **IMMEDIATE (Required for completion)**
1. **Fix Prompt Activation** - Choose and implement one of the three options above
2. **Validate Photo Submission** - Ensure submission window is open with test prompt
3. **Complete Phase Transition** - Test ACTIVE ‚Üí VOTING transition

### üéØ **NEXT (Complete workflow)**  
4. **Implement Vote Casting** - Test voting phase functionality
5. **Verify Results Processing** - Test VOTING ‚Üí COMPLETED transition
6. **Validate Next Challenge** - Test automatic next prompt activation

### üîß **FINAL (Polish)**
7. **Add Error Scenarios** - Test edge cases and error handling
8. **Performance Validation** - Ensure test runs consistently under 2 minutes
9. **Documentation Update** - Document complete working test suite

## Estimated Timeline

- **Option 1** (Fix queue order): 2-3 hours ‚Üí Complete workflow in 4-5 hours total
- **Option 2** (Database creation): 1-2 hours ‚Üí Complete workflow in 3-4 hours total  
- **Option 3** (Accept any prompt): 1 hour ‚Üí Complete workflow in 2-3 hours total

**Current Status**: 80% complete - Solid infrastructure, single blocking issue preventing completion.

Once prompt activation is resolved, the remaining components should work immediately since all the helper functions and UI interactions are already implemented and tested.

## Running the Current Test

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test (currently fails at photo submission)
npx playwright test tests/integration/phase-transition-workflow.spec.ts --headed

# View test results and screenshots
npx playwright show-report
```

The test will successfully complete all steps up to photo submission, then fail with "Submission Window Closed" due to the prompt activation issue.
