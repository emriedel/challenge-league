# Contributing to Glimpse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Glimpse! We're excited to have you help us build a better creative competition platform inspired by Taskmaster.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct:

- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels
- **Be collaborative**: Work together and help each other learn
- **Be patient**: Remember that everyone is learning and growing
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of Next.js and React
- Familiarity with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/glimpse.git
   cd glimpse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in your development environment variables
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type whenever possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (< 200 lines)
- Use custom hooks for complex logic
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Follow the component structure:

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  prop1, 
  prop2 
}) => {
  // Hooks
  // Event handlers
  // Render logic
  
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate state logic
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### File Naming Conventions
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `PromptCard.tsx`)
- Pages: `page.tsx` in app directory (Next.js 13+ convention)
- API Routes: `route.ts` in app/api directories
- Hooks: `camelCase.ts` starting with "use" (e.g., `usePrompts.ts`)
- Utils: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `dateHelpers.ts`)
- Types: `camelCase.ts` ending with "Types" (e.g., `promptTypes.ts`)

## Testing

We maintain high test coverage to ensure code quality:

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all business logic
- Test custom hooks thoroughly
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test API routes with Jest
- Aim for 80%+ coverage

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests
- Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Focus on critical user journeys
- Test on multiple browsers and screen sizes
